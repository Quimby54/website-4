          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>I love my dog, and even though she's 2 years old she still behaves and looks like a puppy</p>
          <p>Because of her I wanted to base this project on puppies. <br>Their loyalty, playfulness and little quirks can make a huge difference in someones day, and does so for mine without fail. <br> Each dog that I've had the past 27 years has had a huge impact on my life, and has made me a person that deeply loves their pet.</p>
